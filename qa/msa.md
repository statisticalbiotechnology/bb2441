# Questions on Algorithms for Multiple Sequence Alignments

* In your video lecture, you mention that some multiple sequence alignment methods/heuristics are more suitable for larger alignments and some are more suitable for smaller alignments. What is a large alignment and what is a small alignment - does this refer to the number of sequences that are aligned, or the length of the sequences?

* How is it possible to do pair wise alignment when one of the "sequences" actually is an alignment itself?

* When aligning a sequence (a) to an alignment (b c), how do we align this?

* Do we use the mean of the scores of (a b) and (a c)? And which path in the dp matrix is chosen?

* In what way is doing the progressive alignment more efficient than doing a pairwise alignment in the first 2 sequences and then align that with the 3rd sequence and so on?

* If the sequences are not so similar to each other , does Progressive Alignment still fit for them ?
