# Algorithms for pairwise Alignments

Before the lecture:

* Read (the rest of) Chapter 3 in [St Clair & Visick](https://www.jblearning.com/catalog/productdetails/9781284033700/)
* Watch the online lecture on [alignment algorithms](https://youtu.be/ACgY8zI0utk). You can find a copy of the slides [here](slides/Algorithms_for_sequence_alignments.pdf)
* Read the [notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/statisticalbiotechnology/bb2441/master?filepath=pairwise%2Fpairwise.ipynb
) on pairwise alignments, skip the section on protein sequence alignments for now.

* Pose at least one question in the appropriate canvas thread.
